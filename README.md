Shuffling Pines: an app for a vaguely ominous place to send one's loved ones.
The main page has a patient submission form, then upon submission automatically switches to a patient management form.
The patient management form has live editing - no submit required.

# gulp options:
## gulp test: runs jshint and karma
## gulp build: builds the source and copies it into dist directory
## gulp autorun: creates an autorun/autobuild server
## default runs build & test

Fastest way to get it up and going:
run npm install and bower install, then run gulp build, then gulp autorun and point your browser to the url it provides, or point your browser at the dist/index.html file.
